Horiseon challenge for BootCamp 1st Challenge.

#### note
This web page has been cobbled together as the original appears to have been corrupted on another machine and the github code for that site does not function correctly despite being the same as the code here.

### Subject for client discussion.
Is it an intentional color mismatch between the header and sidebar and the main article. If not, which color would you like to select for the whole site.

## Action taken to improve the site.

The CSS code has been concatanated in those areas where there was redundancy or repetition. This makes for cleaner and more easily maintained code.

I have made use of CSS variables to facilitate maintence of the site.

While there is still work to be done, I have started to make the site responsive.

####  * To Do CSS
* Add hamburger to the navigation and have the nav menu collapse on small screens.
* Make background image responsive.
* Make side bar sit next to the main articles on big screen and collapse to single column on small screens.
* The navigation links work and the return to top links work as expected. At the moment, when the links are activated, the chosen article is hidden under the nav section. I will adjust this once the nav section is fully collapsable.

###  HTML

Similar to the CSS, all of the redundant and duplicated sections have been rolled into a new section with semantic tags.
